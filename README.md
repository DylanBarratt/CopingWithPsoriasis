# Coping With Psoriasis
<img src="https://github.com/DylanBarratt/CopingWithPsoriasis/blob/main/main.jfif" alt="post"/>
This site was created using the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack">MERN</a> stack. <br />
It was created as a place to host the Coping With Psoriasis blogposts. <br />
The site consists of a front-end (Written in ReactJS) to display the blog posts and a back end to retrieve the blog posts from a MongoDB database. <br />


~~The site can be viewed live at <a href="https://copingwithpsoriasis.com/">copingwithpsoriasis.com</a> (The new version of the site is here, also created by me).~~
<br />
_Note: the .ENV file is missing so the code cannot be used to replicate the site without creating a new one._
